Our project focuses on utilizing an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) equipped with a ZED stereo camera system for car detection using the GROUNDINGDINO algorithm. The ZED camera provides high-resolution stereo images, enabling accurate depth perception crucial for object detection from an aerial viewpoint.
