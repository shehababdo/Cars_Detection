# Cars_Detection

In this project, we employed a ZED stereo camera system implemented on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) along with the advanced GROUNDINGDINO algorithm to detect and localize vehicles, particularly cars, in real-time environments. The ZED camera, renowned for its depth-sensing capabilities, provided high-resolution stereo images from an aerial perspective, enabling precise depth perception essential for accurate object detection.

The GROUNDINGDINO algorithm, a state-of-the-art deep learning-based approach, was leveraged to efficiently detect and classify cars within the UAV's field of view. This algorithm utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on extensive datasets to recognize distinct features and patterns associated with vehicles, ensuring robust detection performance across various environmental conditions.

Our project involved the implementation and fine-tuning of the GROUNDINGDINO algorithm to suit the specific requirements of car detection using the ZED camera mounted on a UAV platform. We optimized the algorithm's parameters and trained it on annotated datasets comprising diverse car instances to enhance its detection accuracy and reliability in aerial scenarios.

Through extensive testing and evaluation, we demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our object detection system in real-world UAV applications. The integration of the ZED camera with the GROUNDINGDINO algorithm facilitated the seamless identification and localization of cars from an aerial viewpoint, enabling applications in aerial surveillance, traffic monitoring, and disaster response.

Overall, our project showcased the potential of combining cutting-edge computer vision techniques with advanced UAV-mounted hardware solutions to address complex challenges in object detection, with a particular focus on enhancing situational awareness and operational capabilities in aerial environments.
